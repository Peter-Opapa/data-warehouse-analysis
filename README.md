# 📊 SQL Analytics & EDA Project
This project is a continuation of my [SQL Server Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/Peter-Opapa/sql-server-data-warehouse-project), where I built a modern data warehouse. In this project, I focus on analysis using the business-ready data from the Gold layer from the Data Warehouse Projet.


This repository is a personal collection of **SQL scripts** I've written for **data exploration, analysis, and reporting**. These scripts help me gain insights from relational databases using **best-practice SQL techniques** quickly.
