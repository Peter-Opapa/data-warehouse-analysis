# ðŸ§ª Data Warehouse Analysis Project

This project is a continuation of my [Data Warehouse project](https://github.com/Peter-Opapa/sql-server-data-warehouse-project), where I built a modern data warehouse using SQL Server. Here, the focus is on the **analytical layer**â€”exploring and deriving insights from the **Gold Layer** (business-ready data).

Using clean and transformed datasets, I performed end-to-end SQL-based analysis and organized the scripts by analytical themes.

## ðŸ“Œ Achievements

I developed a comprehensive suite of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts support:

- Database exploration  
- Time-based trends  
- Cumulative analytics  
- Data segmentation  
- Performance analysis  
- Business reporting
