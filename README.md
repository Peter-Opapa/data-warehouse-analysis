# ðŸ§ª SQL Data Analysis Project

This project is a continuation of my [Data Warehouse project](https://github.com/Peter-Opapa/sql-server-data-warehouse-project), where I built a modern data warehouse using SQL Server. Here, I focus on the analytical sideâ€”exploring and reporting from the **Gold Layer** (business-ready data).

I have uncovered business insights using clean and transformed data. I have performed all the analysis using SQL and organized into modular, theme-specific scripts.

## ðŸ“Œ Achievement

I have made the comprehensive SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as:

- database exploration  
- time-based trends  
- cumulative analytics  
- segmentation  
- performance analysis  
- reporting
